This is the web server for the data communication project.
to run the project you have to first run: 

**npm install**

to install all the neccessary packages.

you can now use a npm command to open up a server.

**npm start**

this command will run the server.js file.

Or if you intend to do changes you can use

**npm run dev**

for easier tuning as it will automatically 
restart the server if you save the project.

to terminate the process use the key bind.

**ctrl + c**
